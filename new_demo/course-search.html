		<h2 class="portfolio-section-title">Overview</h2>
		<p>The goal of this project is to <b>learn React.JS</b> and <b>apply UX theories</b> to create an interface with fairly good usability. 
		My role is to fetch the data from the API provided and dynamically generate React components. Besides, I learned conventional layout structures
		to design the preliminary version of the application. I later employed <b>Hueristic Evaluation</b> to improve the usability of the application.
		This article will focus on the UX design aspect of the project.</p>

		<p>The final version of the application can be accessed <a href="https://su-goh.github.io/CourseScheduler/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> 

		<h2 class="portfolio-section-title">Preliminary design</h2>
		<p>The preliminary design was created while coding the React components of the web app. This design is meant to be temporary and was expected to be changed
			once the engineering aspect of the website is completed.
		</p>
		<p>
			I analyzed the structural and naviagational layout of the preliminary design to gain a further understanding of my design, and how the design can be further
			improved.
		</p>

		<br> <br>

		<p>The biggest improvement is the reduction in context switches. Instead of a tabbed design, I overhauled the design to a 
			SPA to <b>reduce context switch</b> required to glance through information crucial to the users.
		</p>

		<p>I proceed to implementing the design change on React before the next iteration design phase.</p>

		<h2 class="portfolio-section-title">Iteration: Improving usability through Hueristic Evaluation</h2>
		<p>Usability is a very important aspect of UX. It helps ensure the effectiveness of and users' satisfaction of
			the design solutions. I used Hueristic Evaluation to evaluate my design solution and offer severity ratings and 
			design recommendations for each of the violations I have identified.
		</p>
		<br>
		<!-- <p style="font-weight: bold;">10 hueristic evaluation principles: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Visibility of system status</li>
			<li>Match between real world and system</li>
			<li>User control and freedom</li>
			<li>Consistency and standards</li>
			<li>Error prevention</li>
			<li>Recognition rather than recall</li>
			<li>Flexibility and efficiency of use</li>
			<li>Aesthetic and minimialistic design</li>
			<li>Help users with errors</li>
			<li>Help and documentation</li>
		</ul> -->

		<h5 class="portfolio-subtitle">1. Identify a focus</h5>
		<p>In this part, I will be focusing the following components as part of the hueristic evaluation process.
		</p> <br>

		<p>a. Search bar</p> 
		<img class="portfolio-pic" src="images/scheduler/filter_before.png" alt="screenshot of search bar">
		
		<p><br>b. Course accordion</p>
		<img class="portfolio-pic" src="images/scheduler/course_before.png" alt="screenshot of course accordion">
		<br>
		<p><br>c. Cart</p>
		<div class="center-img">
			<img class="portfolio-pic" style="width: 30%;" src="images/scheduler/cart_before.png" alt="screenshot of course accordion">
		</div>

		<br> <br>

		<h5 class="portfolio-subtitle">2. Identify violations</h5>
		<p>I evaluate each components with the 10 huersitics and assign a severity rating on the scale of 0-4 (grey, green, yellow, orange, red). Cyan represents the hueristic that's
			already present in the current implementation.

		<h5 class="portfolio-subtitle">4. Implementation</h5>
		<p>From the results above, I chose 3 of the recommendations I have suggested above to implement.</p> 

		<p>a. Prompt notifications on course successfully added to the cart</p> 
		<div class="center-img">
			<img class="portfolio-pic" style="width: 50%;"  src="images/scheduler/AddedToCart.png" alt="screenshot of notification on success added to cart">
		</div>
		<br>
		<p>b. Prompt notifications when user added a course in which they did not meet the pre-requisites required</p>
		<div class="center-img">
			<img class="portfolio-pic" style="width: 50%;"  src="images/scheduler/PrereqNotMet.png" alt="screenshot of notification when pre-req not met">
		</div>
		<br>
		<p>c. Error message to notify users on no course associated with the search results</p>
		<div class="center-img">
			<img class="portfolio-pic rounded-corners" style="width: 100%;" src="images/scheduler/NoFound.png" alt="screenshot of error message on no result return">
		</div>
		<h2 class="portfolio-section-title">Conclusion & Reflections</h2>

		<p>
			Through this process, my design has become more user friendly. The user can now understand more on what has happened – <b>Notifications</b> to notify 
			users when a course is added to the cart and when users added a course that they did not meet pre-req of to the cart. 
			An <b>error message</b> is also shown on screen when users’ filter yield no results. With this it might be less confusing for 
			novice users to navigate around the user interface to perform the task they intended. Overall, it allowed the user to better 
			understand their actions and what can and cannot be done.

			<br><br>

			I found out that the hueristic approach really guided me to finding ways to improve on my design. These guides create a comprehensive outlook for 
			system designers to make sure they are no blind spots that they might have missed. <br> <br>
