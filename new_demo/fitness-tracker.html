        <h2 class="portfolio-section-title">Overview</h2>
        <p>The goal of the project is to <b>practice the iterative design process</b> - from <b>paper prototype</b> to <b>hi-fi Static Prototype</b>
        and finally <b>interactive hi-fi prototype</b> and to <b>learn the basics of React Native</b>. The prototypes are completed
        using <b>Adobe XD</b>.</p>

        <h2 class="portfolio-section-title">Paper Prototyping</h2>
        <img class="rounded-corners portfolio-pic" style="margin-bottom: 30px;" src="images/fitness/paper_overview.jpg" alt="intro picture of paper prototype">
        <p>I started by drawing out quick <b>sketches</b> of the possible components. The paper prototype allowed me to think about the interactions of the users with the 
        system. However, the functionality of the app is pre-defined based on assignment requirements.</p>

        <h2 class="portfolio-section-title">Static Prototype</h2>
        <p>After defining the structural and navigational components of the application, I then move on to design the <b>hi-fi static prototype</b>
        using <b>Adobe XD</b>.</p>

        <h2 class="portfolio-section-title">Interactive Prototype</h2>
        <p>To <b>stimulate the experience</b> the users might be having, I continue to add interactions to the static prototype
            to create an interacive prototpye that could be used for usability testing.
        </p>

        <h2 class="portfolio-section-title">Implementation</h2>
        <p>Due to time constraints and basic requirement of the assignment, the design of the implementation looks less polished as the design above.
            The main goal of the implementation phase is to learn <b>React Native</b> as this is my first time learning React Native.
            However, I tried my best to maintain the navigational structure of the design.
        </p>

        <p>
        The API is provided to me. My responsibility is to design the component hierarchy and implement it using <b>React Native</b>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="portfolio-section-title">Conclusion and Reflections</h2>
        <p>I have learned a lot about the iterative process of designing from lo-fi to hi-fi. I also learned that the design for 
            lo-fi are meant to gain an overall understanding of how the app might look like, rather than commiting to that design.
            The design of the final product has changed quite significantly since the paper prototype as more low level details has to
            be defined.
        </p>

        <p>Just to iterate, this project was meant to <b>gain an understanding of the iterative design process</b> rather than being a 
        case study. In the real world however, user research such as contextual inquiry should be performed before designing
        application.</p>

        <p>As this was my first time using React Native, it was very rewarding as I <b>gained an understanding of basics of React Native</b>.
        If I have had more time, I would have tried to implement the design as closely as the prototype as possible.</p>
