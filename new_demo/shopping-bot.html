        <h2 class="portfolio-section-title">Overview</h2>
        <p>As Natural Language Processing (NLP) gets better in recent years, there is an up trend in adopting conversational
            agent in home devices and customer support. Traditional prototype methods are unable to be utilized in designing 
            conversational agents since it relies on our tacit knowledge. Luckily, <b>Experience Prototype</b> seem to be 
            a great fit to prototype chat bots. In this project, I will be using experience prototyping methods such as 
            <b>bodystorming</b> to design a conversational agent for a clothing retail website, and implement it using 
            <b>Google's DialogFlow</b>. After that, a simple <b>usability test</b> was performed as a practice.
        </p>

        <h2 class="portfolio-section-title">Experience Prototype - Bodystorming</h2>
        <p>Designing a conversational interface is particularly challenging as conventional prototype methods do not work, and our understanding of
        conversation is part of our tacit knowledge. Hence, <b>experience prototype</b> can help solve this challenge.
        </p>

            <h4 class="bold-text">Context</h4>
            <p>Users interact with a conversational shopping assistant embedded within a clothing retail website.</p>

            <h4 class="bold-text"><br>Scenarios & Design Goals</h4>
            
            <p><b>Scenario 1: Searching for items in a specific category</b> <br>
            Return a list of best reviewed products in the category.</p>

            <p><b>Scenario 2: View items in their cart</b> <br>
            Inform the user about the name of the products, quantity of those products in their cart, sorted by time added.</p>
            
            <p><b>Scenario 3: Purchase items in cart</b> <br>
            Confirm with user items in their cart, and proceed to checkout.</p>

            <p><b>Scenario 4: Searching for a specific product</b> <br>
            Return the general information about the product such as price, availability, and ratings.</p>

            <p><b>Scenario 5: Adding a product into the cart</b> <br>
            Add the specified product to the user's cart based on the quantity provided, and reaffirms that to the user.</p>

            <p><b>Scenario 6: Narrowing down a search</b> <br>
            Show only the products that fits the tags or filters specified by the user.</p>

            <p><b>Scenario 7: Inquiring about a product</b> <br>
            Provide the information about the product such as price, rating, and reviews to the user.</p>

            <p><b>Scenario 8: Navigating around the website</b> <br>
            Redirects to the page the user is seeking for.</p>

            <h4 class="bold-text"><br>Setting up environment</h4>
            <p>A pre-built clothing retail website was used.</p>
            <img class="portfolio-pic rounded-corners" src="./images/shopping-bot/home_2.png" alt="Screenshot of the homepage of a simple clothing retail website">

            <h4 class="bold-text"><br>Acting out interaction</h4>
            <p>A participant was invited to act out the interactions with the environment setted up above. <b>The participant acted as a possible user</b>
                querying the shopping assistant with questions and commands, while <b>I acted as the conversational agent</b> replying to the queries and
                commands made by the participant. Each scenarios was being acted out twice two simulate different experience of the same scenario.
                The session was recorded and transcribed to be analyzed later.
            </p>

            <h4 class="bold-text"><br>Insights</h4>
            <p>The session with the participant was <b>transcribed</b> and the interactions are being converted to a <b>flowchart</b> based on the patterns
            of interactions identified.</p>

            <p>The flowchart of the first scenario - searching for items in a specific category is shown below.</p>
            <img class="portfolio-pic" src="./images/shopping-bot/flowchart.png" alt="The flowchart of the scenario - searching for items in a specific category"> 

        <h2 class="portfolio-section-title">Implementation</h2>
        <p>First, the <b>entities and intents</b> are being created based on the results of experience prototype above. For each intent, at least ten training
        phrases are created to train the DialogFlow AI model and at least three responses from the agent are created. For each entities, at least five examples
        are created.</p>

        <p>An example of intent, its' training phrases and response from agent: <br>
        <b>Intent:</b> Searching for a product <br>
        <b>Training phrase:</b> 'I would like to purchase the Supreme shirt.', 'Do you still have stocks for the Supreme shirt?' <br>
        <b>Agent response:</b> 'This is the Supreme shirt you are looking for', 'I found Supreme shirt, is this what you are looking for?'
        </p>

        <p>An example of entity: <br>
        <b>Entity: </b> Quantity <br>
        <b>Example: </b> one, 2, all, some, a few
        </p>

        <p>My responsibility is to write the <b>webhook</b> using <b>JavaScript</b> that is connected to DialogFlow. Since DialogFlow is a 
        'build once deploy everywhere' chat-bot, it is usable on multiple platforms such as on the web, messaging applications, and even phone calls.</p>
        
        <p>A demonstration of the implementation can be viewed here:</p>

        </div>

        <h2 class="portfolio-section-title">Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>A "mini" usability testing was performed. The goal of the testing is to get a taste of usability testing. <b>Efficiency</b> & 
        <b>Engagement</b> of the system are the focus of the study. The two metrics used in the usability testing is <b>time of task completion</b>
        and <b>SUS questionnaire</b>. A test plan is then developed with clearly defined goals, scenarios, procedures, and metrics.</p>

        <p>The usability testing was performed by two participants. <b>Think aloud protocol</b> was being encouraged throughout the usability test.
        After the test was completed, a brief interview with follow up questions were conducted.</p>
        <br>

        <h4><b>Two Main Findings</b></h4>
        <!-- <p>Based on the SUS questionnaire, the shopping assistant bot receieve <b>a grade of "C"</b> (in the range of good and exellent).</p> -->
        <p><b>1.</b> Due to the constraint of the website, the website is simple enough and users tend to want to
        interact with web page as they feel it is quicker for a simple system, i.e. <b>agent is less efficient.</b> <br> <br>
        <b>2.</b> The agent is somewhat satisfying to use, but the user are <b>unaware of the capabilities and
        features of agent</b>, and <b>wrong intents matched confuses the user</b>, which affects the user experience.</p>
        <br>
            
        <h4><b>Design recommendations for the next iteration</b></h4>
        <p>
            <b>1. Add a ‘help’ intent</b> and have the agent return actions/queries that the user might be able to take
            for them to better understand the capability of agent. In addition, provide a documentation or
            in-depth help page to see a comprehensive list of features of the agent. <br> <br>
            <b>2. Provide suggestions to possible actions</b> to the user while the user is asking for something. For
            example, when the user asks about “I want to know more about Jump Around Shirt”, after
            returning the results, let the user know possible queries they can take, i.e. ask about price,
            reviews, and add item to cart. <br> <br>
            <b>3. Require the user to log in</b> before using agent, even if queries that do not require log in. This
            provides a more comprehensive and consistent user experience to the user.
        </p>

        <h2 class="portfolio-section-title">Conclusion and Reflections</h2>
        <p>From this project, I <b>gained an understanding of the basics of experience prototyping</b> and how it can be used.
        Though only the simplified version of usability testing was performed, I <b>get a sense of how usability testing works and 
        their importance</b>. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 restrictions, the experience prototyping and usability testing has to be
        performed virtually. However, it works out perfectly since in the real world, users would also be interacting with the chat bot
        in a virtual space.</p>
        
        <p>I also got a chance to <b>learn how to build a bot using DialogFlow</b>, as well as design conventions for a conversational 
        agent. Although the scenarios are not as complicated as most commercialized chat bots, being able to learn how to develop a
        chat bot without using pre-existing chat-bot builder is rewarding as the industry is still adopting the use of conversational
        agent to assist their customers.</p>
